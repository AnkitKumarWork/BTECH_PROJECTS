 BTECH RESEARCH WORK 
 MINOR PROJECT - “ Hand Gesture Recognition Using Arduino and TinyML ,” 
 The foundation for my research was laid during my B. Tech project titled “ Hand Gesture Recognition  Using Arduino Nano BLE and TinyML(using edge impulse machine training platform) ” where I  explored practical applications of machine learning in real-time systems. I used some sensors to detect  hand movements and gestures. This project not only solidified my interest in the field but also provided  hands-on experience in developing efficient algorithms for gesture recognition, an essential component of  intuitive human-machine interfaces

 MAJOR PROJECT -  “ Hand Gestures Recognition using Computer Vision ” 
 Building upon my previous research on minor project, my major project, “ Hand Gestures Recognition  using Computer Vision ” allowed me to further explore the intricacies of machine perception. This project  focused on the development of computer vision algorithms that are capable of interpreting human  gestures using open source media pipe Python library., thereby facilitating a more natural and interactive  form of communication between humans and machines. With various applications.
